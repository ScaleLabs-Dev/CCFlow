# Command: /cf:checkpoint

Create comprehensive memory bank checkpoint with Documentarian agent.

---

## Usage

```
/cf:checkpoint [--message "description"]
```

## Parameters

- `[--message "description"]`: **Optional** - Custom checkpoint description (default: auto-generated from recent work)

---

## Purpose

Engage the Documentarian agent to:
1. Capture current project state across all memory bank files
2. Document recent work, decisions, and learnings
3. Update ALL memory bank files with latest context
4. Create checkpoint entry in progress.md for session continuity
5. Preserve knowledge for future sessions and team members

---

## Prerequisites

**Memory bank must be initialized**. Run `/cf:init [project-name]` first if needed.

**Active work to checkpoint**. Use after completing meaningful work, not at project start.

---

## When to Use

**Recommended checkpoint triggers**:
- After completing significant task or milestone
- Before ending work session (session boundaries)
- After making important architectural decisions
- Before risky operations (creates restore point)
- Every 30-60 minutes during intensive work sessions
- After discovering new patterns or learnings
- When switching between major tasks or focus areas

**Time-based guideline**: Every 30-60 minutes of active development work.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Memory Bank Exists

Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists:

**If NOT EXISTS**:
```
⚠️ Memory Bank Not Initialized

Run: /cf:init [project-name]
```

**Stop execution.**

---

### Step 2: Gather Checkpoint Context

**Load all memory bank files**:
- `projectbrief.md` - Original scope for comparison
- `productContext.md` - Feature status
- `systemPatterns.md` - Patterns and conventions
- `activeContext.md` - Current state before checkpoint
- `progress.md` - Historical checkpoints for continuity
- `tasks.md` - Task statuses and completion

**Scan recent work**:
- Use Git (if available): `git log --since="last checkpoint time" --oneline`
- Review `activeContext.md` "Recent Changes" section
- Identify completed tasks from tasks.md since last checkpoint
- Note any new files created or significant edits

**Determine checkpoint scope**:
- What work was completed since last checkpoint?
- What decisions were made?
- What patterns emerged or changed?
- What was learned?
- What's the current project state?

---

### Step 3: Engage Documentarian Agent

**Invoke Documentarian agent** from `.claude/agents/workflow/documentarian.md`.

**Provide context**:
- All loaded memory bank files
- Recent work summary (git log, file changes, task completions)
- Custom message (if --message flag provided)
- Timestamp for checkpoint entry

**Documentarian will**:
1. Analyze recent work and changes
2. Identify key accomplishments and learnings
3. Update ALL memory bank files systematically
4. Create comprehensive checkpoint entry
5. Ensure cross-file consistency
6. Preserve important context for continuity

---

### Step 4: Documentarian Updates Memory Bank

**Documentarian performs systematic updates** to all memory bank files:

#### progress.md - Add Checkpoint Entry

**Add to "Checkpoint Entries" section**:

## Error Handling

### Memory Bank Not Initialized

```
⚠️ Memory Bank Not Initialized

Memory bank not found at: memory-bank/

To initialize, run: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init MyProject
```

### No Recent Work to Checkpoint

```
⚠️ No Recent Changes Detected

Last checkpoint: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] ([duration] ago)

No significant changes detected since last checkpoint:
- No tasks completed
- No files changed
- No new decisions or learnings

Consider working on tasks first, then checkpoint.

Alternatively, use --message flag to create manual checkpoint:
/cf:checkpoint --message "your reason for checkpoint"
```

### Git Not Available (Warning Only)

```
ℹ️ Git not available

Could not access git log for recent changes analysis.

Proceeding with checkpoint based on memory bank changes only.

For best checkpoint quality, consider using git for version control.

[Continues with checkpoint...]
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**Typical workflow patterns**:

```
# Task completion checkpoint
/cf:code TASK-023 → Implementation complete
/cf:review TASK-023 → Quality check passes
/cf:checkpoint → Document completion and learnings

# Session boundary checkpoint
[Work on multiple tasks...]
/cf:checkpoint --message "End of work session"
[Next day: Resume with context from checkpoint]

# Decision checkpoint
/cf:plan TASK-030 --interactive → Major architectural decision made
/cf:checkpoint --message "Architecture decision: [description]"

# Pre-risky operation checkpoint
/cf:checkpoint --message "Before database migration - restore point"
/cf:code TASK-031 → Execute risky operation
[If successful] /cf:checkpoint
[If failed] Restore from last checkpoint context

# Periodic checkpoint during intensive work
[30 minutes of work...]
/cf:checkpoint
[Continue working...]
[30 minutes more...]
/cf:checkpoint
```

**Recommended checkpoint frequency**:
- **After every completed task**: Capture learnings and progress
- **Every 30-60 minutes**: During intensive development sessions
- **Before risky operations**: Create restore points
- **End of work sessions**: Preserve context for next session
- **After major decisions**: Document rationale and alternatives
- **When new patterns emerge**: Preserve knowledge for team

---

## Notes

- Checkpoint is **non-invasive**: Doesn't change code, only memory bank
- **All memory bank files updated** for comprehensive state preservation
- Documentarian ensures **cross-file consistency** (no contradictions)
- Checkpoints create **session continuity** for resuming work
- **Custom messages** (`--message`) useful for restore points and context markers
- Git integration **enhances but not required** for checkpointing
- Checkpoints **preserve learnings** that might otherwise be forgotten
- **Team knowledge sharing**: Checkpoints document "why" behind decisions
- Can be used as **rollback reference** if needed to understand prior state
- **Lightweight operation**: Reads/writes memory bank only, no code changes

---

## Related Commands

- `/cf:code` - Implementation (checkpoint after completion)
- `/cf:review` - Quality assessment (checkpoint often includes review)
- `/cf:sync` - Read-only status (checkpoint is write operation)
- `/cf:plan` - Planning (checkpoint after significant planning sessions)
- `/cf:status` - Quick status without full checkpoint
