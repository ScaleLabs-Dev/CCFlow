# Command: /cf:context

Load active project context to resume work efficiently.

---

## Usage

```
/cf:context [--full]
```

## Parameters

- `[--full]`: **Optional** - Load comprehensive context including all memory bank files (default: active context only)

---

## Purpose

Quickly load relevant project context to:
1. Resume work after interruption or session break
2. Understand current project state before starting tasks
3. Load active focus, recent changes, and next steps
4. Minimize time spent re-orienting to project state
5. Provide foundation for immediate productive work

---

## Prerequisites

**Memory bank must be initialized**. Run `/cf:init [project-name]` first if needed.

**Some project history**. Works best after at least one checkpoint has been created.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Memory Bank Exists

Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists:

**If NOT EXISTS**:
```
⚠️ Memory Bank Not Initialized

Run: /cf:init [project-name]
```

**Stop execution.**

---

### Step 2: Determine Context Scope

**Default (no flags)**:
- Load **active context only** for quick resumption
- Minimal memory bank reading for fast operation
- Focus on "what to do next"

**With --full flag**:
- Load **comprehensive context** including all memory bank files
- Full project understanding
- Useful for deep work or after long time away

---

### Step 3: Load Active Context (Default Mode)

**Read activeContext.md**:

Extract and present:

1. **Current Focus**: What task/area is actively being worked on
2. **Recent Changes**: Last 5-10 entries from recent changes log
3. **Immediate Next Steps**: Prioritized next actions
4. **Active Decisions**: Decisions currently being made or considered
5. **Blockers**: Any impediments to progress

**Read tasks.md** (targeted):

Extract and present:

1. **Active Tasks**: Tasks currently in progress with their status
2. **Next Pending Task**: Highest priority not-yet-started task
3. **Blocked Tasks**: Tasks waiting on dependencies or external factors

**Optional Git Integration**:

If git is available, show:
- Current branch
- Uncommitted changes (if any)
- Recent commits (last 3-5)

---

### Step 4: Load Full Context (--full Flag Mode)

**Read ALL memory bank files**:

1. **projectbrief.md**: Scope, objectives, constraints
2. **productContext.md**: Features, requirements, user context
3. **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture, patterns, conventions
4. **activeContext.md**: Current state (same as default mode)
5. **progress.md**: Completed work, milestones, technical debt
6. **tasks.md**: All tasks (full list, not just active)

**Synthesize comprehensive understanding**:
- Project goals and current progress toward them
- Technical approach and established patterns
- Completed vs. remaining work
- Current focus in context of overall project

---

## Key Decisions

**Recent Decisions** (Last 5):
1. **2025-10-03**: Use Stripe over PayPal for payment processing
   - Rationale: Better developer experience, lower fees, stronger fraud detection

2. **2025-09-15**: PostgreSQL over MongoDB for data storage
   - Rationale: ACID guarantees needed for financial data, team expertise

3. **2025-09-10**: Microservices architecture (3 services)
   - Rationale: Team scale, independent deployment, service boundaries clear

4. **2025-08-28**: React with Vite over Next.js
   - Rationale: SPA sufficient, no SSR needed, team preference

5. **2025-08-20**: TypeScript enforcement across codebase
   - Rationale: Type safety, better IDE support, fewer runtime errors

[See projectbrief.md for full decision log with alternatives considered]

## Blockers & Risks

**Blockers**: None currently

**Risk Assessment**:
- Active Risks: 2 risks being monitored
  - Risk: Stripe API rate limits in production
  - Mitigation: Implementing request queuing and retry logic

User: /cf:context

Claude:
[Loads activeContext.md - finds no current focus...]

📋 ACTIVE CONTEXT
─────────────────────────────

**Project**: New Project
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-05 09:00 (initialization)
**Session**: New (No active work yet)

## Current Focus

**No active focus set**

The project was recently initialized but no tasks have been started yet.

## Recent Activity

1. **2025-10-05 09:00** - Project initialized
   - Impact: Memory bank created
   - Action: /cf:init command

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create first task** (Priority: High)
   - Command: /cf:feature [task description]
   - Context: Define what needs to be built first

2. **Review project brief** (Priority: Medium)
   - File: memory-bank/projectbrief.md
   - Context: Understand project scope and objectives

3. **Set up development environment** (Priority: Medium)
   - Context: Initialize git, install dependencies, configure tools

## Active Tasks

**No tasks created yet**

Use /cf:feature [description] to create your first task.

## Blockers

None.

## Git Status

**Branch**: main (or not initialized)
**Status**: Clean working directory

---

**Ready to Start**:
Recommended next action: Create your first task

Command: /cf:feature [description of first feature to build]

Example: /cf:feature set up user authentication system

**Estimated Context Load Time**: 1 second
```

---

## Error Handling

### Memory Bank Not Initialized

```
⚠️ Memory Bank Not Initialized

Memory bank not found at: memory-bank/

To initialize, run: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init MyProject
```

### Memory Bank Empty

```
⚠️ No Context Available

Memory bank exists but contains no active context.

Suggestions:
1. Create your first task: /cf:feature [description]
2. Review project brief: Read memory-bank/projectbrief.md
3. Check initialization: /cf:sync

The memory bank needs content before context can be loaded.
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**Typical workflow patterns**:

```
# Starting new session
/cf:context → Load where you left off
[Resume work on current task]
/cf:checkpoint → Save progress

# After long break
/cf:context --full → Deep re-immersion
/cf:ask [questions] → Clarify any confusion
[Resume work with full understanding]

# Multiple times per session
/cf:context → Quick re-orient before switching tasks
/cf:code TASK-[ID] → Work on task
/cf:context → Check what's next

# New team member
/cf:context --full → Understand entire project
/cf:ask [questions] → Deep dive on specific areas
[Get up to speed efficiently]
```

**When to use each mode**:

**Default mode** (/cf:context):
- Starting work session
- Quick re-orientation
- Checking next steps
- Multiple times per day

**Full mode** (/cf:context --full):
- After vacation or long break
- New team member onboarding
- Before major planning sessions
- Deep project understanding needed
- First time working on project area

---

## Notes

- **Read-only operation**: Never modifies memory bank
- **Fast default mode**: 1-3 seconds to load active context
- **Comprehensive full mode**: 5-10 seconds for complete project understanding
- **Smart recommendations**: Suggests specific next action based on state
- **Git integration**: Shows uncommitted work and recent commits if available
- **Session awareness**: Detects new vs. resumed sessions
- **Efficient resumption**: Minimize "where was I?" time
- **Pairs with /cf:ask**: Use /cf:context for overview, /cf:ask for specific questions

**Best practices**:
- Run /cf:context at start of every work session
- Use default mode for quick daily resumption
- Use --full mode after time away (>1 week) or for deep understanding
- Follow recommended next action for efficient workflow
- Combine with /cf:ask for clarification on specific items
- Create checkpoint before ending session to ensure context is current

---

## Related Commands

- `/cf:sync` - Full memory bank status (more detailed than /cf:context)
- `/cf:ask` - Query specific information (targeted vs. overview)
- `/cf:status` - Quick task list (less context than /cf:context)
- `/cf:checkpoint` - Create checkpoint to update context
- `/cf:code` - Typical next action after loading context
