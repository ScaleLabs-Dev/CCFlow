# Command: /cf:init

Initialize CCFlow memory bank and agent system for a new project.

---

## Usage

```
/cf:init [project-name]
/cf:init [project-name] --interactive
```

## Parameters

- `[project-name]`: **Required** - Name of the project to initialize

## Flags

- `--interactive`: Engage Facilitator agent for guided project brief creation

---

## Purpose

Initialize the CCFlow workflow system by:
1. Creating memory bank directory structure
2. Copying templates to create initial memory bank files
3. Creating .claude agent directory structure (if not exists)
4. Optionally guiding interactive project brief creation

---

## Prerequisites

**None** - This is the bootstrap command, first command to run.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Check if Already Initialized

Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists:

**If EXISTS**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CCFlow Already Initialized

Memory bank exists at: memory-bank/

To view current state, run: /cf:sync
To reinitialize, manually delete memory-bank/ first (‚ö†Ô∏è destroys existing data)
```

**Stop execution if already initialized.**

---

### Step 2: Create Memory Bank Structure

If NOT initialized, create directory and copy templates:

```bash
# Create memory-bank directory
mkdir -p memory-bank

# Copy all template files, removing .template extension
cp memory-bank/templates/projectbrief.template.md memory-bank/projectbrief.md
cp memory-bank/templates/productContext.template.md memory-bank/productContext.md
cp memory-bank/templates/systemPatterns.template.md memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
cp memory-bank/templates/activeContext.template.md memory-bank/activeContext.md
cp memory-bank/templates/progress.template.md memory-bank/progress.md
cp memory-bank/templates/tasks.template.md memory-bank/tasks.md
```

### Step 3: Populate Initial Values

**Update each file** with project name and current date:

**In ALL memory bank files**, replace:
- `[Project Name]` ‚Üí `{project-name from user input}`
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` ‚Üí `{current date}`
- `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` ‚Üí `{current timestamp}`

**In projectbrief.md specifically**:
- Add initial revision history entry
- Set version to 1.0
- Mark status as "Planning"

**In tasks.md specifically**:
- Initialize summary tables with zeros
- Set up structure ready for first task

**In progress.md specifically**:
- Set "Current Phase" to "Planning"
- Set "Completion" to "0%"
- Set "Overall Status" to "Not Started"

**In activeContext.md specifically**:
- Set "Current Focus" to "Project initialization"
- Add initial change log entry for initialization

---

### Step 4: Create .claude Structure (if needed)

Check if `.claude/` exists:

**If NOT EXISTS**:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents/workflow
mkdir -p .claude/agents/development/specialists
mkdir -p .claude/agents/testing/specialists
mkdir -p .claude/agents/ui/specialists
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

**Copy hub agent templates** to `.claude/agents/`:
```bash
# Copy the 3 hub agent templates with TODO sections
cp [CCFlow location]/.claude/agents/testing/testEngineer.md .claude/agents/testing/
cp [CCFlow location]/.claude/agents/development/codeImplementer.md .claude/agents/development/
cp [CCFlow location]/.claude/agents/ui/uiDeveloper.md .claude/agents/ui/
```

**Note**: Workflow agents are NOT copied - they are invoked from CCFlow location directly.

---

### Step 5: Interactive Mode (if --interactive flag)

If `--interactive` flag is present:

**Engage Facilitator agent** for guided project brief creation:

```markdown
üîÑ INTERACTIVE PROJECT SETUP

I'll help you create a comprehensive project brief through guided questions.

## Project Overview

**Q1: What is this project?**
[User answers]

**Q2: What problem does it solve?**
[User answers]

**Q3: Who is it for?**
[User answers]

---

## Scope & Objectives

**Q4: What are the must-have features (P0)?**
[User lists features]

**Q5: What are your primary objectives?**
[User lists objectives with success metrics]

**Q6: What are your constraints (technical, timeline, resources)?**
[User describes constraints]

---

## Success Criteria

**Q7: How will you know this project is successful?**
[User defines success criteria]

---

[Facilitator refines and validates responses]

‚úÖ Project brief created and saved to memory-bank/projectbrief.md

Would you like to continue refining, or proceed with this brief?
```

**Facilitator updates projectbrief.md** with responses.

---

### Step 6: Output Success Confirmation

```markdown
‚úÖ CCFlow Initialized Successfully

## Structure Created

üìÅ **Memory Bank** (`memory-bank/`):
   ‚úì projectbrief.md     - Foundation document (scope, goals, requirements)
   ‚úì productContext.md   - User needs and features
   ‚úì systemPatterns.md   - Architecture and coding patterns
   ‚úì activeContext.md    - Current work tracking
   ‚úì progress.md         - Status and milestones
   ‚úì tasks.md            - Task management

üìÅ **Agent System** (`.claude/agents/`):
   ‚úì testing/testEngineer.md       - TDD coordination (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs customization)
   ‚úì development/codeImplementer.md - General implementation (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs customization)
   ‚úì ui/uiDeveloper.md              - UI development (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs customization)

   Workflow agents available from CCFlow:
   - Assessor, Architect, Product, Documentarian, Reviewer, Facilitator

## Next Steps

### 1. Customize Hub Agents for Your Tech Stack

**Action Required**: Edit the hub agent files and fill in TODO sections

**Files to customize**:
- `.claude/agents/testing/testEngineer.md`
- `.claude/agents/development/codeImplementer.md`
- `.claude/agents/ui/uiDeveloper.md`

**What to customize**:
- Testing framework and commands
- Tech stack details
- Coding conventions
- Specialist routing rules

**Example**:
```markdown
<!-- In testEngineer.md, find TODO sections like: -->

### Testing Framework
framework: "jest"  # ‚Üê Fill in your framework
test_directory: "__tests__/"  # ‚Üê Your test directory
```

### 2. Review Memory Bank

Run: `/cf:sync`

This will load and summarize your memory bank state.

### 3. Start Your First Feature

Run: `/cf:feature [description]`

Example: `/cf:feature add user authentication`

This will:
- Assess task complexity
- Route to appropriate workflow
- Update tasks.md with new task

## Error Handling

### If Already Initialized

```
‚ö†Ô∏è CCFlow Already Initialized

Memory bank exists at: memory-bank/

Current status: [Read from progress.md]
Last updated: [Read from activeContext.md]

To view current state, run: /cf:sync

To reinitialize:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will destroy existing project data
2. Manually delete memory-bank/ directory
3. Run /cf:init [project-name] again
```

### If Project Name Missing

```
‚ùå Error: Project name required

Usage: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init MyAwesomeProject
```

### If Template Files Missing

```
‚ùå Error: CCFlow templates not found

Expected location: memory-bank/templates/

This command requires the CCFlow system to be set up with template files.

Please ensure you're running from the CCFlow directory or that templates are available.
```

## Related Commands

- `/cf:sync` - Review memory bank state after initialization
- `/cf:feature` - Start first feature after initialization

---

## Notes

- This command is idempotent - running it twice won't break anything (it will just warn and stop)
- Template files remain in `memory-bank/templates/` for reference
- Hub agents must be customized for your tech stack before use
- Workflow agents (Assessor, Architect, etc.) are used directly from CCFlow, no copying needed
