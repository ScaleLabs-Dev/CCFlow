# Command: /cf:plan

Create implementation plan with Architect + Product agents, breaking down complex tasks.

---

## Usage

```
/cf:plan [task-id]
/cf:plan [task-id] --interactive
```

## Parameters

- `[task-id]`: **Required** - Task ID to plan (e.g., TASK-003)

## Flags

- `--interactive`: Engage Facilitator agent for collaborative planning refinement

---

## Purpose

Create comprehensive implementation plan by:
1. Loading task details and project context
2. Engaging Architect agent for technical design
3. Engaging Product agent for user requirements
4. Breaking down into implementation steps
5. Creating sub-tasks in tasks.md
6. Updating systemPatterns.md if new patterns emerge

---

## Prerequisites

- **Memory bank initialized**: Run `/cf:init [project-name]` first
- **Task exists**: Use `/cf:feature [description]` to create task first
- **Task requires planning**: Level 2-4 complexity (Level 1 can skip directly to `/cf:code`)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

**Check memory bank exists**:
```
If NOT EXISTS:
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory bank not initialized. Run: /cf:init [project-name]
```

**Check task exists in tasks.md**:
```
If NOT FOUND:
‚ùå Task [task-id] not found in tasks.md

Available tasks:
- TASK-001: [name]
- TASK-002: [name]

Create new task with: /cf:feature [description]
```

**Check task complexity**:
```
If Level 1:
‚ö†Ô∏è Task [task-id] is Level 1 (Quick Fix)

Level 1 tasks don't require planning.

Proceed directly with: /cf:code [task-id]
```

---

### Step 2: Load Context

Read required memory bank files:
- `tasks.md` - Task details, complexity, description
- `activeContext.md` - Current project state
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architectural patterns to follow
- `productContext.md` - User needs and UX requirements
- `projectbrief.md` - Project goals and constraints
- `CLAUDE.md` - Tech stack reference

Extract task information:
- Task description
- Complexity level
- Acceptance criteria
- Any existing notes or context

---

### Step 3: Engage Architect Agent

**Architect analyzes technical approach**:

1. Understand requirements from task description
2. Load architectural patterns from systemPatterns.md
3. Load tech stack from CLAUDE.md
4. Design solution approach:
   - Component architecture
   - Data flow
   - State management
   - Integration points
   - Technical decisions with trade-offs

**Architect Output**: Technical implementation plan

---

### Step 4: Engage Product Agent

**Product analyzes user requirements**:

1. Understand user need from task description
2. Load product context from productContext.md
3. Define requirements:
   - Functional requirements (must/should/could have)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, accessibility)
   - User experience requirements
   - Success criteria
   - Edge cases

**Product Output**: User-focused requirements and UX considerations

---

### Step 5: Synthesize Plan (Standard Mode)

Combine Architect and Product perspectives into comprehensive plan:

- Clear visual feedback during search
- Empty state handling

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Users can search from any page
- ‚úÖ Results appear within 200ms
- ‚úÖ Fully keyboard navigable

---

### üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECT PERSPECTIVE

**Technical Approach**: Client-side search with debounced API calls

**Component Architecture**:
1. **SearchInput Component**
   - Purpose: Capture search input with debouncing
   - Responsibilities: Input handling, focus management
   - Dependencies: Search service

2. **SearchResults Component**
   - Purpose: Display search results
   - Responsibilities: Results rendering, keyboard navigation
   - Dependencies: Search data

3. **Search API Endpoint**
   - Purpose: Query backend for results
   - Responsibilities: Database query, result formatting

**Data Flow**:
```
User Input ‚Üí Debounce (300ms) ‚Üí API Call ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Display
```

**Technical Decisions**:

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Migrate Authentication to OAuth 2.0

[Initial plan presented with Architect + Product perspectives]

---

üîÑ INTERACTIVE PLANNING

Facilitator: I've reviewed the initial plan. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

**Q1: OAuth Provider**
The plan assumes a single OAuth provider (Google). Do you want to support multiple providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) from the start, or add that later?

User: Start with Google only, add others later

Facilitator: Good, that simplifies Phase 1. I'll update the plan.

**Q2: Migration Strategy**
Two options for existing users:
A) Parallel auth (support both old and OAuth simultaneously, migrate gradually)
B) Hard cutover (force all users to re-authenticate)

Option A is safer but more complex. Your preference?

User: Option A - parallel auth, don't want to disrupt users

Facilitator: Understood. This adds complexity but is the right choice for UX.

**Q3: Data Migration**
Should we migrate existing user emails to OAuth automatically, or require users to manually link accounts?

User: Automatic migration where emails match

Facilitator: Got it. This requires careful handling of edge cases.

[Architect updates plan based on responses...]

---

## üîÑ REFINED PLAN

**Updated Approach**:
- Single OAuth provider (Google) for Phase 1
- Parallel authentication (both systems running)
- Automatic email-based account linking
- Gradual user migration strategy

**Sub-tasks Adjusted**:
- Added: Parallel auth middleware (routes to correct auth system)
- Added: Account linking logic (email matching)
- Added: Migration tracking (dashboard to monitor progress)

[Updated implementation steps shown...]

---

Facilitator: Does this refined approach address your needs, or should we adjust further?

User: Looks good

Facilitator: Excellent. One final consideration:

**Testing Strategy for Migration**
Given the risk, I recommend:
1. Unit tests for all auth paths
2. Integration tests for account linking
3. Manual testing with test accounts before production

Should I add a sub-task for comprehensive testing?

User: Yes, add that

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL PLAN

[Complete refined plan with testing sub-task added]

**Total Sub-tasks**: 8 (was 5, added migration and testing tasks)
**Estimated Total Effort**: 14 hours (was 10, adjusted for added complexity)

‚úì Updated tasks.md with 8 sub-tasks
‚úì Updated activeContext.md

---

‚Üí RECOMMENDATION: Plan is comprehensive and ready

   Begin with: /cf:code TASK-006-1

   Consider running /cf:checkpoint before starting to save this planning work.
```

---

## Error Handling

### Task Not Found

```
‚ùå Task TASK-099 not found in tasks.md

Available tasks:
- TASK-001: Fix header typo
- TASK-002: Add navbar search
- TASK-003: User authentication

Create new task with: /cf:feature [description]
```

### Task Already Planned

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Task TASK-005 already has implementation plan

Sub-tasks exist:
- TASK-005-1: Create API endpoint
- TASK-005-2: Create search component

To update plan:
1. Review existing sub-tasks in tasks.md
2. Use /cf:facilitate to refine if needed
3. Or proceed with: /cf:code TASK-005-1
```

### Level 1 Task (Doesn't Need Planning)

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Task TASK-004 is Level 1 (Quick Fix)

Level 1 tasks are straightforward and don't require planning.

Proceed directly with: /cf:code TASK-004

Planning is only needed for Level 2-4 tasks.
```

---

## Memory Bank Updates

### tasks.md
- Parent task marked as "Planning Complete"
- Sub-tasks created with IDs TASK-[ID]-1, TASK-[ID]-2, etc.
- Effort estimates added
- Dependencies noted

### activeContext.md
- Recent change entry added
- Immediate next steps updated if high priority

### systemPatterns.md (if applicable)
- New patterns documented
- ADR reference added if architectural decision made

---

## Notes

- Planning is **required** for Level 2-4 tasks before implementation
- Sub-tasks are always Level 1 or 2 (never Level 3-4)
- If sub-task seems Level 3+, it should be broken down further
- Interactive mode (`--interactive`) highly recommended for Level 3-4
- Architect and Product work together, providing complementary perspectives
- Plan can be refined later with `/cf:facilitate` if needed

---
