# Command: /cf:sync

Read and summarize current memory bank state, providing project status snapshot.

---

## Usage

```
/cf:sync
/cf:sync --verbose
```

## Flags

- `--verbose`: Include detailed content from each memory bank file

---

## Purpose

Synchronize your understanding of the project by:
1. Loading all 6 core memory bank files
2. Summarizing current project state
3. Identifying any inconsistencies or gaps
4. Confirming readiness for development

---

## Prerequisites

**Memory bank must be initialized**. If not, command will suggest `/cf:init`.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Memory Bank Exists

Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists:

**If NOT EXISTS**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Bank Not Initialized

CCFlow memory bank not found.

To initialize, run: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init MyProject
```

**Stop execution if not initialized.**

---

### Step 2: Load All Memory Bank Files

Read the following files:
1. `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
2. `memory-bank/productContext.md`
3. `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
4. `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
5. `memory-bank/progress.md`
6. `memory-bank/tasks.md`

**If any file is missing**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Missing memory bank file

Expected: memory-bank/[filename].md
Status: Not found

This may indicate incomplete initialization or file deletion.

Consider reinitializing or creating the missing file from templates.
```

---

### Step 3: Extract Key Information

From each file, extract:

**From projectbrief.md**:
- Project name
- Project overview (first paragraph)
- P0 features (must-have)
- Primary objectives
- Critical constraints

**From productContext.md**:
- Key problems being solved
- Implemented features count
- Planned features count
- Primary user flows

**From systemPatterns.md**:
- Architecture style
- Key technologies (frontend, backend, database)
- Number of active patterns documented

**From activeContext.md**:
- Current focus (primary task)
- Last updated timestamp
- Immediate next steps (top 3)
- Active blockers (if any)
- Recent changes (last 5)

**From progress.md**:
- Current phase
- Overall completion percentage
- Status (On Track/At Risk/Behind)
- Next milestone
- Completed features count
- Remaining work (P0 count)
- Known issues (count by severity)

**From tasks.md**:
- Active tasks count
- Pending tasks count
- Blocked tasks count
- Completed tasks count
- Task summary by priority and complexity

---

### Step 4: Identify Gaps or Inconsistencies

Check for:

**Missing Information**:
- Empty or placeholder sections (e.g., "[Project Name]" still present)
- No active tasks or focus defined
- Objectives without success metrics

**Inconsistencies**:
- activeContext.md says task X is active, but tasks.md shows it as complete
- progress.md shows features complete that aren't in completed log
- Conflicting priorities or timelines

**Warnings**:
- Blocked tasks with no resolution plan
- Overdue milestones
- High-priority tasks pending for long time

## Error Handling

### Memory Bank Not Initialized

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Bank Not Initialized

CCFlow memory bank not found at: memory-bank/

To initialize, run: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init TaskManager

This will create the memory bank structure and initialize all required files.
```

### Missing Memory Bank Files

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Incomplete Memory Bank

Missing files:
- memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
- memory-bank/tasks.md

This may indicate:
- Incomplete initialization
- Files were deleted
- Corrupted memory bank

To resolve:
1. Check if files exist but in wrong location
2. Copy from memory-bank/templates/ if available
3. Run /cf:init again (‚ö†Ô∏è may overwrite changes)
```

### Corrupted or Malformed Files

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Memory Bank File Error

File: memory-bank/progress.md
Issue: Unable to parse or extract information

Continuing with available files...

Recommendation: Review the file for formatting issues or restore from backup.
```

---

## Integration with Other Commands

After `/cf:sync`, you typically:

- **If newly initialized**: `/cf:feature [description]` to start first feature
- **If active work**: `/cf:code [task]` to continue implementation
- **If planning phase**: `/cf:plan [task]` to create implementation plan
- **If milestone reached**: `/cf:checkpoint [message]` to save state

---

## Notes

- This command is read-only - it never modifies memory bank files
- Safe to run frequently for status checks
- Verbose mode useful for deep debugging or detailed reviews
- Output designed to be human-readable and actionable
