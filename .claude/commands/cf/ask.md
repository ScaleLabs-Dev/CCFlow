# Command: /cf:ask

## Usage

```
/cf:ask [question]
```

## Parameters

- `[question]`: **Required** - Natural language question about project context, decisions, patterns, or history

---

## Purpose

Provide intelligent query interface to memory bank for:
1. Quick knowledge retrieval without manual file reading
2. Cross-file semantic search and synthesis
3. Historical context and decision rationale lookup
4. Pattern and convention discovery
5. Project understanding for new team members or resumed sessions

---

## Prerequisites

**Memory bank must be initialized**. Run `/cf:init [project-name]` first if needed.

**Some memory bank content**. Works best after project has checkpoints and documentation.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Verify Memory Bank Exists

Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists:

**If NOT EXISTS**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Bank Not Initialized

Run: /cf:init [project-name]
```

**Stop execution.**

---

### Step 2: Parse Query Intent

**Analyze question to determine**:
- **Query type**: What, Why, When, Where, How, Who
- **Subject domain**: Architecture, decisions, patterns, tasks, features, progress
- **Scope**: Specific item, general knowledge, historical context
- **Relevant files**: Which memory bank files likely contain answer

**Query classification examples**:

| Question | Type | Domain | Files |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| "Why did we choose microservices?" | Why | Decision | projectbrief.md, progress.md |
| "What's our error handling pattern?" | What | Pattern | systemPatterns.md |
| "When did we complete the auth feature?" | When | History | progress.md, tasks.md |
| "How do we structure API responses?" | How | Pattern | systemPatterns.md, productContext.md |
| "Where is the user authentication logic?" | Where | Code location | systemPatterns.md, activeContext.md |
| "What tasks are blocked?" | What | Status | tasks.md |

---

### Step 3: Load Relevant Memory Bank Files

**Based on query classification, load targeted files**:

**For decision questions** (Why did we...):
- `projectbrief.md` - Decision log
- `progress.md` - Checkpoint entries with decision rationale
- `systemPatterns.md` - Pattern decisions

**For pattern/convention questions** (How do we...):
- `systemPatterns.md` - Active patterns and conventions
- `productContext.md` - Non-functional requirements

**For feature/requirement questions** (What features...):
- `productContext.md` - Feature tables and requirements
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown and acceptance criteria

**For status/progress questions** (What's the status...):
- `tasks.md` - Task statuses and blockers
- `progress.md` - Completed work and milestones
- `activeContext.md` - Current focus and next steps

**For historical questions** (When did we...):
- `progress.md` - Checkpoint entries with timestamps
- `tasks.md` - Task completion dates
- `activeContext.md` - Recent changes log

**For current work questions** (What am I working on...):
- `activeContext.md` - Current focus and recent changes
- `tasks.md` - Active tasks

**For comprehensive questions** (Tell me about the project):
- Load ALL files for full context synthesis

---

### Step 4: Search and Extract

**Use native Claude tools** for semantic search:

1. **Read** relevant memory bank files
2. **Grep** for specific keywords or patterns if question is narrow
3. **Semantic extraction**: Understand content and synthesize answer
4. **Cross-reference**: Connect information across multiple files if needed

**Search strategies by question type**:

**Specific item lookup**:
- Grep for exact terms (task ID, feature name, pattern name)
- Read section directly
- Return concise answer

**Conceptual understanding**:
- Read full relevant files
- Synthesize understanding
- Provide comprehensive explanation

**Historical timeline**:
- Grep for dates or task IDs
- Construct chronological sequence
- Return timeline

**Decision rationale**:
- Search decision logs
- Find checkpoint entries mentioning decision
- Extract rationale and alternatives considered
- Return full decision context

## Examples

### Example 1: Decision Rationale Question

```
User: /cf:ask Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?

Claude:
[Loads projectbrief.md and progress.md, searches for database decision...]

üéØ DECISION RATIONALE

**Question**: Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary database

**When**: 2025-09-15 (from projectbrief.md decision log)

**Rationale**:
Strong ACID guarantees required for financial transaction data. Team has
PostgreSQL expertise. Complex relational queries needed for reporting features.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MongoDB - Rejected: No ACID transactions, eventual consistency not acceptable for financial data
- MySQL - Rejected: PostgreSQL has better JSON support needed for flexible user preferences

**Trade-offs**:
‚úÖ **Gains**:
- Data integrity guarantees (critical for finance)
- Rich query capabilities (complex reports)
- JSON support (flexible schemas where needed)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Costs**:
- Potentially higher learning curve for junior devs
- Less flexible schema evolution than NoSQL

**Source**: projectbrief.md (Decision Log, entry 3), progress.md (Checkpoint 2025-09-15)
```

### Example 2: Pattern Question

```
User: /cf:ask How do we handle errors in API responses?

Claude:
[Loads systemPatterns.md, searches for error handling pattern...]

üîß PATTERN/PROCEDURE

**Question**: How do we handle errors in API responses?

**Approach**:
All API errors follow RFC 7807 Problem Details format with consistent structure.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.com/errors/validation-failed",
  "title": "Validation Failed",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Email field is required",
  "instance": "/api/users/create",
  "errors": {
    "email": ["Required field missing"]
  }
}
```

**Rationale**:
Standardized format provides consistent developer experience, enables client-side
error handling without special cases, follows industry best practice (RFC 7807).

**Related Patterns**:
- Logging pattern: All errors logged with correlation ID
- Client error handling: Frontend uses typed error parser

**Source**: systemPatterns.md (Active Patterns ‚Üí Error Handling Pattern)
```

### Example 3: Status Question

```
User: /cf:ask What tasks are currently blocked?

Claude:
[Loads tasks.md, searches for blocked status...]

üìã ANSWER

**Question**: What tasks are currently blocked?

**Answer**:
2 tasks currently blocked:

1. **TASK-027: Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Blocker: Waiting for production API credentials from vendor
   - Since: 2025-10-01
   - Owner: Sarah

2. **TASK-033: Performance Testing**
   - Blocker: Staging environment configuration incomplete (depends on TASK-032)
   - Since: 2025-10-03
   - Owner: Mike

**Context**:
Both blockers are external dependencies. TASK-027 has vendor ticket #12345
open. TASK-032 (staging setup) is 80% complete, expected resolution tomorrow.

**Related Information**:
- 8 other tasks are in progress without blockers
- 12 tasks are pending (not started)

## Error Handling

### Memory Bank Not Initialized

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Bank Not Initialized

Memory bank not found at: memory-bank/

To initialize, run: /cf:init [project-name]

Example: /cf:init MyProject
```

### Empty Memory Bank

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Bank Empty

Memory bank exists but contains no meaningful content.

Have you completed any work yet?

Steps to populate memory bank:
1. /cf:feature [description] - Create and work on tasks
2. /cf:checkpoint - Document progress and decisions
3. /cf:ask [question] - Query preserved knowledge

Currently, memory bank has no answers to provide.
```

### Missing Question

```
‚ùå Error: Question required

Usage: /cf:ask [question]

Examples:
- /cf:ask Why did we choose React?
- /cf:ask What's our error handling pattern?
- /cf:ask What tasks are blocked?
- /cf:ask When did we complete authentication?
```
