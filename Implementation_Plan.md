# CCFlow Implementation Plan

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for the CCFlow workflow system, based on analysis of [Workflow_spec.md](Workflow_spec.md) and [Command_and_role_spec.md](Command_and_role_spec.md). The plan addresses identified gaps, proposes resolutions, and outlines a phased implementation approach.

---

## Critical Gaps & Issues Identified

### 1. Agent Terminology Inconsistency ⚠️

**Issue**: Two specifications use different agent terminology
- **Workflow_spec.md** references: Developer, Architect, Product agents
- **Command_and_role_spec.md** uses: codeImplementer, testEngineer, uiDeveloper

**Impact**: Confusion about agent roles and responsibilities

**Resolution**: Create TWO distinct agent layers:
- **Workflow Layer** (`.claude/agents/workflow/`): Coordination agents for workflow orchestration
  - Assessor, Architect, Product, Documentarian, Reviewer, Facilitator
- **Implementation Layer** (`.claude/agents/development/`, `testing/`, `ui/`): Code execution agents
  - testEngineer, codeImplementer, uiDeveloper, specialists

### 2. Missing Agent Definitions ❌

**Issue**: The following workflow agents are referenced but not defined:

| Agent | Purpose | Referenced In | Missing Definition |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Assessor | Complexity assessment | /feature command | ✗ Agent file missing |
| Architect | System design | /plan command | ✗ Agent file missing |
| Product | Requirements/UX | /plan command | ✗ Agent file missing |
| Facilitator | Interactive refinement | --interactive flag | ✗ Agent file missing |
| Documentarian | Memory bank maintenance | /checkpoint, /review | ✗ Agent file missing |
| Reviewer | Quality assessment | /review command | ✗ Agent file missing |

**Resolution**: Create all 6 workflow agent files in Phase 2

### 3. Missing Command Implementations ❌

**Issue**: Command files referenced but not created:

| Command | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| /cf:init | Initialize memory bank | ✗ Not created |
| /cf:sync | Sync memory bank state | ✗ Not created |
| /feature | Entry point with complexity routing | ✗ Not created |
| /plan | Planning mode | ✗ Not created |
| /review | Code review | ✗ Not created |
| /checkpoint | Save state | ✗ Not created |
| /ask | Query specific agent | ✗ Not created |
| /context | Memory bank navigation | ✗ Not created |
| /status | Quick status | ✗ Not created |
| /facilitate | Interactive refinement | ✗ Not created |
| /create-specialist | Create specialist agent | ⚠️ Partially specified |
| /code | TDD implementation | ✓ Fully specified |

**Resolution**: Create all command files in Phases 4-7

### 4. Unresolved Configuration Decisions 🤔

**Issue**: From Workflow_spec.md "Configuration Options" - several "[TO BE DECIDED]" items:

1. **Memory Bank Update Strategy**
   - Option A: Automatic after major changes
   - Option B: Only on explicit commands (/review, /checkpoint)
   - Option C: Hybrid (track automatically, commit manually)
   - **Recommendation**: Option C (Hybrid)

2. **Context Loading Strategy**
   - Option A: Auto-load relevant files based on command
   - Option B: Always read everything at session start (/sync required)
   - Option C: Only load on explicit request
   - **Recommendation**: Option A (Auto-load with /sync for refresh)

3. **File Structure Modifications**
   - Option A: Keep all 6 core files as-is
   - Option B: Merge some files (specify which)
   - Option C: Add specialized files (specify what)
   - **Recommendation**: Option A (Keep structure, proven by Cline)

4. **Interactive Mode Default**
   - Should `--interactive` be default, opt-in, or configurable?
   - **Recommendation**: Opt-in via flag (efficiency by default)

**Resolution**: Finalize in Phase 0, document in updated spec

### 5. Bootstrap Sequence Unclear 🔄

**Issue**: No clear first-time setup flow specified
- What's the very first command a user runs?
- How does system detect if it's initialized?
- What happens if user runs /code before /cf:init?

**Resolution**: Define bootstrap flow:
```
1. User runs: /cf:init [project-name]
2. System creates memory-bank/ and .claude/ structure
3. System prompts for project brief information
4. System generates initial memory bank files from templates
5. System confirms: "CCFlow initialized. Run /cf:sync to see status"
```

**Error Handling**:
- All commands check for memory-bank/ existence
- If missing: "Memory bank not initialized. Run /cf:init first."
- /cf:init checks if already initialized: "Already initialized. Use /cf:sync to view."

### 6. Command vs Agent Responsibility Boundary 🎭

**Issue**: Unclear separation between command and agent responsibilities

**Resolution**:
- **Commands** (.claude/commands/):
  - Orchestration and routing logic
  - Flag parsing and mode selection
  - Memory bank I/O operations
  - Agent invocation with context
  - Error handling and validation

- **Agents** (.claude/agents/):
  - Analysis and decision-making
  - Content generation
  - Framework-specific logic
  - Quality assessment
  - No direct file I/O (work through command context)

### 7. Complexity Assessment Implementation 📊

**Issue**: Assessor needs codebase knowledge to estimate scope
- How does it know "5-10 files" without analyzing?
- Should it scan codebase before assessment?

**Resolution**: Assessor agent uses two-phase approach:
1. **Keyword Analysis**: Initial complexity estimate from task description
2. **Codebase Scan** (if Level 2+):
   - Use Glob to count relevant files
   - Use Grep to find related patterns
   - Adjust complexity based on actual scope
   - Cache project structure for session

## Implementation Phases

### PHASE 0: Resolve Design Decisions ✅

**Objective**: Finalize all design decisions before implementation begins

**Decisions to Document**:

1. **Agent Organization Structure**
   ```
   .claude/agents/
   ├── workflow/          # Workflow coordination agents
   │   ├── assessor.md
   │   ├── architect.md
   │   ├── product.md
   │   ├── documentarian.md
   │   ├── reviewer.md
   │   └── facilitator.md
   ├── development/       # Implementation agents
   │   ├── codeImplementer.md
   │   └── specialists/   # Optional specialists
   ├── testing/
   │   ├── testEngineer.md
   │   └── specialists/
   └── ui/
       ├── uiDeveloper.md
       └── specialists/
   ```

2. **Memory Bank Strategy**: Hybrid
   - Commands auto-update activeContext.md during execution
   - /checkpoint and /review formally commit state with summaries
   - All updates timestamped and attributed to agent/command

3. **Context Loading Strategy**: Smart Auto-Load
   - Commands declare required memory bank files
   - System auto-loads on command execution
   - /cf:sync forces full reload and summary
   - Efficient: only load what's needed per command

4. **Flag Parsing Pattern**:
   ```markdown
   # In command files:
   ## Process
   1. Parse user input for flags:
      - If contains "--interactive": Engage Facilitator agent
      - If contains "--impl-only": Skip TDD steps
      - If contains "--agent=X": Override default agent selection
   ```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Update Workflow_spec.md with finalized decisions
- [ ] Document agent responsibility boundaries

## Recommended Design Resolutions

### 1. Agent Naming Convention ✅

**Decision**: Use TWO distinct agent layers with clear separation

**Workflow Agents** (`.claude/agents/workflow/`):
- Assessor, Architect, Product, Documentarian, Reviewer, Facilitator
- Responsible for: Workflow orchestration, analysis, documentation
- Invoked by: Commands for coordination tasks

**Implementation Agents** (`.claude/agents/development/`, `testing/`, `ui/`):
- testEngineer, codeImplementer, uiDeveloper
- Responsible for: Code generation, testing, implementation
- Invoked by: /code command and workflow agents

**Specialists** (`.claude/agents/[domain]/specialists/`):
- Created as needed for specific expertise
- Invoked by: Hub agents for delegation

### 2. Memory Bank Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Hybrid approach (Option C)

**Automatic Tracking**:
- Commands update activeContext.md during execution
- Changes logged with timestamp and attribution
- Lightweight, non-intrusive updates

**Explicit Commit**:
- /checkpoint: Full memory bank review and formal save
- /review: Quality assessment with memory bank updates
- User controls when to "commit" state

**Benefits**:
- Balance between automation and control
- Continuous tracking without overhead
- Formal checkpoints for important milestones

### 3. Context Loading Strategy ✅

**Decision**: Smart Auto-Load (Option A with enhancements)

**Approach**:
- Each command declares required memory bank files
- System auto-loads only needed files on execution
- /cf:sync forces full reload and provides summary
- Caching within session for efficiency

**Example**:
```markdown
# In /code command:
## Required Context
- tasks.md (task details)
- activeContext.md (current focus)
- systemPatterns.md (patterns to follow)
- CLAUDE.md (tech stack reference)
```

**Benefits**:
- Efficient token usage (load only what's needed)
- Fast execution (no unnecessary I/O)
- User control with /cf:sync for full context

### 4. Flag Parsing Pattern ✅

**Decision**: Pattern matching in command instructions

**Implementation**:
```markdown
# In command files:
## Process

### Step 1: Parse Flags
Check user input for flags:
- If contains "--interactive": Engage Facilitator agent for refinement
- If contains "--impl-only": Skip TDD steps (test verification still required)
- If contains "--agent=X": Override default agent selection with X
- If contains "--verbose": Include detailed explanations in output
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple, clear pattern for Claude Code to follow
- No complex parsing logic needed
- Extensible (easy to add new flags)

### 5. Bootstrap & Error Handling ✅

**Decision**: Graceful initialization with helpful guidance

**Bootstrap Flow**:
```
1. User runs: /cf:init [project-name]
2. System checks: memory-bank/ exists?
   - If yes: "Already initialized. Run /cf:sync to view state."
   - If no: Proceed with initialization
3. Create structure, copy templates, customize
4. Confirm: "✅ Initialized. Next: /cf:sync then /feature"
```

**Error Handling**:
```
All commands check prerequisites:
- If memory-bank/ missing:
  "⚠️ Memory bank not initialized. Run /cf:init [project-name] first."
- If .claude/ missing:
  "⚠️ Agent system not initialized. Run /cf:init [project-name] first."
- If task not found:
  "❌ Task [id] not found in tasks.md. Run /feature to create tasks."
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

1. **Agent Coordination Complexity**
   - Risk: Agents may not coordinate smoothly
   - Mitigation: Test agent interactions early, refine delegation logic
   - Contingency: Simplify to single-agent approach if needed

2. **TDD Enforcement Reliability**
   - Risk: Test verification gate might be bypassed
   - Mitigation: Make GREEN requirement explicit in all agents
   - Contingency: Add validation checks in /checkpoint and /review

3. **Memory Bank Consistency**
   - Risk: Updates may conflict or become inconsistent
   - Mitigation: Single source of truth per data element, clear update ownership
   - Contingency: Add /validate command to check consistency

### Medium Risk Items

1. **User Learning Curve**
   - Risk: System may be complex for new users
   - Mitigation: Create comprehensive QUICKSTART.md, clear error messages
   - Contingency: Add /help command with guided workflows

2. **Performance Overhead**
   - Risk: Multiple agent invocations may slow down workflow
   - Mitigation: Optimize context loading, cache within sessions
   - Contingency: Add --fast flag to skip non-essential steps

3. **Template Customization**
   - Risk: Users may struggle to customize templates
   - Mitigation: Provide rich examples and TODO markers
   - Contingency: Create /cf:wizard for guided customization

### Low Risk Items

1. **Specialist Creation Adoption**
   - Risk: Users may not create specialists when beneficial
   - Mitigation: Hub agents suggest specialist creation when appropriate
   - Contingency: Provide pre-built specialist examples

2. **Flag Usage Complexity**
   - Risk: Users may not discover or use available flags
   - Mitigation: Document flags in command outputs, help text
   - Contingency: Make useful flags default behavior
