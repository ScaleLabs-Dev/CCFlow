---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

#### New Project
```bash
/cf:init MyProject
```

#### Existing Project (Auto-Import)
```bash
/cf:init MyProject
# Detects README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json
# Offers to import existing documentation
# Pre-populates memory bank → validate → fill gaps
```

#### Force Fresh (Ignore Existing Docs)
```bash
/cf:init MyProject --force-fresh
```

**What gets created:**
- `memory-bank/` directory with 6 core files
- Project context (imported from docs OR guided creation)
- Foundation for structured development

**Import Sources** (if detected):
- README.md → Executive Summary, Features, Problem Statement
- CLAUDE.md → Tech Stack, Constraints, Patterns
- package.json → Dependencies, Framework detection
- Code structure → Architecture style, Component patterns

### 2. Customize Hub Agents (Important!)

Before first use, edit these 3 files to match your tech stack:

**Testing Configuration** (`.claude/agents/testing/testEngineer.md`):
```yaml
Testing Framework: [Jest, Pytest, etc.]
Test Commands: [npm test, pytest, etc.]
Coverage Thresholds: [80%, 90%, etc.]
```

**Development Configuration** (`.claude/agents/development/codeImplementer.md`):
```yaml
Tech Stack: [Node.js, Python, Go, etc.]
Coding Conventions: [ESLint, Black, etc.]
Project Patterns: [From systemPatterns.md]
```

**UI Configuration** (`.claude/agents/ui/uiDeveloper.md`):
```yaml
UI Framework: [React, Vue, Angular, etc.]
Styling: [CSS-in-JS, TailwindCSS, etc.]
Component Conventions: [Naming, structure]
```

### 3. Start Building

```bash
# Create your first task
/cf:feature "implement user authentication"

# Plan it (if Level 2-4 complexity)
/cf:plan TASK-001 --interactive

# Implement with TDD
/cf:code TASK-001

# Save progress
/cf:checkpoint
```

---

## Command Reference

### Initialization (2)
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/cf:init [project-name]` | Bootstrap project with memory bank (auto-imports existing docs) |
| `/cf:init [project-name] --force-fresh` | Bootstrap with empty templates (ignore existing docs) |
| `/cf:sync` | Read-only memory bank status summary |

### Core Workflow (3)
| Command | Purpose | Agent(s) |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/cf:feature [description]` | Entry point for new work | Assessor |
| `/cf:plan TASK-[ID] [--interactive]` | Plan Level 2-4 tasks | Architect, Product, Facilitator |
| `/cf:code TASK-[ID]` | TDD implementation with GREEN gate | testEngineer, Hub agents |

### Support (6)
| Command | Purpose | Agent(s) |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/cf:review [task-id\|all]` | Quality assessment | Reviewer |
| `/cf:checkpoint [--message "..."]` | Save progress | Documentarian |
| `/cf:ask [question]` | Query memory bank | None (semantic search) |
| `/cf:context [--full]` | Load work context | None (file reads) |
| `/cf:status [--filter ...]` | Quick task overview | None (file reads) |
| `/cf:facilitate [topic] [--mode ...]` | Interactive refinement | Facilitator |

### Agent Management (1)

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Simple Task (Level 1)
```bash
/cf:feature "fix login button styling"
# → Assessor rates as Level 1
# → Direct to implementation

/cf:code TASK-001
# → testEngineer writes tests (RED)
# → uiDeveloper implements (GREEN)
# → Done in < 2 hours
```

### Complex Feature (Level 3)
```bash
/cf:feature "implement order management system"
# → Assessor rates as Level 3
# → Requires planning

/cf:plan TASK-002 --interactive
# → Architect designs system
# → Product defines requirements
# → Facilitator refines through dialogue
# → Creates sub-tasks

/cf:code TASK-002-1  # First sub-task
# → TDD workflow
# → Specialists may be delegated to

/cf:checkpoint  # Save progress
/cf:review TASK-002-1  # Quality check
```

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning: Load context
/cf:context
/cf:status

# Work: Implement tasks
/cf:code TASK-[ID]

# Regular: Save progress
/cf:checkpoint  # Every 30-60 minutes

# End of day: Review and save
/cf:review all
/cf:checkpoint --message "End of day"
```

## Agent Architecture

### Workflow Agents (6)
Located in `.claude/agents/workflow/`:

| Agent | Responsibilities |
|-------|------------------|
| **Assessor** | Complexity evaluation, routing decisions, codebase scanning |
| **Architect** | System design, technical planning, architecture decisions |
| **Product** | Requirements, user experience, feature prioritization |
| **Documentarian** | Memory bank maintenance, checkpoint creation, knowledge preservation |
| **Reviewer** | Code quality, technical debt, progress evaluation |
| **Facilitator** | Interactive refinement, gap identification, collaborative exploration |

### Implementation Hub Agents (3)
Stack-agnostic coordinators that delegate to specialists:

| Hub Agent | Domain | Delegates To |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **testEngineer** | TDD coordination | Testing specialists |
| **codeImplementer** | Backend/business logic | Development specialists |
| **uiDeveloper** | Frontend/UI | UI specialists |

### Creating Specialists
```bash
# Create a database specialist
/cf:create-specialist database --type development --name databaseSpecialist

# Create a chart specialist for UI
/cf:create-specialist data-visualization --type ui --name chartSpecialist

# Create an API integration test specialist
/cf:create-specialist api-integration --type testing --name apiIntegrationSpecialist
```

## Memory Bank System

### 6 Core Files

Located in `memory-bank/`:

| File | Purpose | Updated By |
|------|---------|------------|
| **projectbrief.md** | Scope, objectives, constraints, decisions | Manual + Documentarian |
| **productContext.md** | Features, requirements, user flows | Product agent + Documentarian |
| **systemPatterns.md** | Architecture, patterns, conventions | Architect agent + Documentarian |
| **activeContext.md** | Current focus, recent changes, next steps | All agents + Documentarian |
| **progress.md** | Completed work, milestones, checkpoints, tech debt | Reviewer + Documentarian |
| **tasks.md** | Task tracking, status, complexity, sub-tasks | Assessor + various agents |

### Update Strategy

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Auto-tracked changes during operations
- Explicit commit via `/cf:checkpoint`
- Agents update relevant files during workflow
- Documentarian ensures cross-file consistency

---

## TDD Workflow

**Absolute Requirement**: Tests must pass (100% GREEN gate)

### RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

```bash
/cf:code TASK-001

# Step 1: RED Phase (testEngineer)
# - Write failing tests FIRST
# - Tests define expected behavior
# - No implementation yet

# Step 2: GREEN Phase (Hub Agent)
# - Implement to make tests pass
# - May delegate to specialists
# - Verify ALL tests pass

# Step 3: GREEN Gate Enforcement
# ✅ Tests pass → Update memory bank, mark complete
# ❌ Tests fail → Iterate (max 3 attempts)
# ❌ Still failing → STOP, report blocker

# Step 4: REFACTOR (Optional)
# - Improve code while maintaining GREEN
# - Tests must stay passing
```

**GREEN Gate is Non-Negotiable**: Implementation cannot be marked complete until all tests pass.

---

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Name | Criteria | Time | Routing |
|-------|------|----------|------|---------|
| **1** | Quick Task | Simple, 1-2 files | < 2 hours | `/cf:code` (direct) |
| **2** | Simple Enhancement | 2-5 files, clear scope | 2-6 hours | `/cf:plan` required |
| **3** | Intermediate Feature | 5-15 files, moderate complexity | 1-3 days | `/cf:plan` required |
| **4** | Complex Project | 15+ files, high complexity | 3+ days | `/cf:plan` required |

**Assessor agent** analyzes:
- Keywords (implementation indicators)
- Scope (files/components affected)
- Risk (dependencies, unknowns)
- Effort (estimated time)

---

## Interactive Modes

### Facilitator Modes

**Exploration** (`--mode explore`):
- Open-ended discovery
- Ambiguous requirements
- Early-stage ideation

**Refinement** (`--mode refine`, default):
- Improve existing plans
- Fill gaps in specifications
- Resolve ambiguities

**Validation** (`--mode validate`):
- Pre-implementation check
- Catch assumptions
- Edge case discovery

### Example Usage

```bash
# Explore a new feature idea
/cf:facilitate "notification preferences" --mode explore

# Refine an existing plan
/cf:facilitate TASK-042 --mode refine

# Validate before implementation
/cf:facilitate TASK-035 --mode validate
```

## Best Practices

### Regular Workflow

✅ **DO**:
- Run `/cf:checkpoint` every 30-60 minutes
- Use `/cf:context` at session start
- Run `/cf:review` before marking tasks complete
- Create specialists when patterns emerge (3+ delegations)
- Follow TDD workflow (tests first, always)
- Use `/cf:status` for quick orientation

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip writing tests (TDD is enforced)
- Mark tasks complete with failing tests
- Let more than 1 hour pass without checkpoint
- Create specialists prematurely (wait for patterns)
- Ignore technical debt from `/cf:review`

### Planning Strategy

**Level 1** (Quick tasks):
- Go straight to `/cf:code`
- Keep it simple and fast

**Level 2-4** (Complex tasks):
- Always use `/cf:plan` first
- Use `--interactive` for ambiguous requirements
- Break into sub-tasks
- Validate plan with `/cf:facilitate --mode validate`

### Quality Management

- Run `/cf:review all` weekly
- Address high-priority tech debt promptly
- Track quality trends in `progress.md`
- Update `systemPatterns.md` as patterns evolve
